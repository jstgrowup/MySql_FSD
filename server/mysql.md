- My sql is a Database management system 
- It is basically a software which is used to manage the database
- No one can directly put data into database it has to be processed through a software called DBMS(Database Management system)
- the data will first go to DBMS and than the DBMS will process it and than it will store the data into the database
- DBMS is just like a middleware it will be there in both post and get methods 
- DBMS examples
   - Oracle
   - MySQL
   - PostgreSQL
   - MongoDB
- `two types of Databases`
   1. Relational Databases: 
    - The data are stored in the form of tables this is the reason it is also known as RDBMS
    - These DBMS uses SQL(structured Query Language) to communicate with the databases
    - If the database is Relational datbase than we will need RDBMS
    - When we are using RDBMS we have to know SQL
    - Examples
       - Oracle
       - MySQL
       - PostgreSQL
   2. NoSQL:
    - NoSQL is not a Table-based Database
    - NoSQL databases are document based
    - Examples
       - MongoDB
       - Redis
       - Cassandra
- Advantages if MySQL
  - It is a cross platform which means can be used in any OS
  - It can be used with multiple languages (PHP,NodeJS,Python,C#)
  - MySQL is a open source software
  - MySQL is a RDBMS
  - The MySQL Database Server is fast ,reliable,scalable and easy to use.
  - MySQL Server works in client/server or embedded systems
